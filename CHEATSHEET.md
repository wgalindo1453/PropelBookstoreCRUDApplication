### propel config:convert

- **Command**: `propel config:convert`
- **Description**: This command converts the Propel configuration file (e.g., `propel.yaml` or `propel.json`) into a PHP configuration script. It reads the runtime section of the configuration file and generates the corresponding PHP script.
- **Output**: A message indicating successful creation of the `config.php` file, like: "Successfully wrote PHP configuration in file `C:/xampp/htdocs/mypropel/generated-conf/config.php`."
- **Purpose**: The generated `config.php` file is used by Propel at runtime to understand the database settings and other configurations.

### propel model:build

- **Command**: `propel model:build`
- **Description**: Generates PHP model classes based on your schema definition (e.g., `schema.xml`). These classes represent your database tables and relationships in PHP code.
- **Output**: Messages indicating the creation of model classes, typically in a directory like `generated-classes/`.
- **Purpose**: Allows you to interact with your database using object-oriented PHP, making database operations more manageable and intuitive.

### propel sql:build

- **Command**: `propel sql:build`
- **Description**: This command generates SQL code from the database schema defined in `schema.xml`. It creates the SQL statements needed to set up your database schema.
- **Output**: SQL files that contain the database schema creation commands. Usually stored in a directory like `generated-sql/`.
- **Purpose**: Provides a way to create your database schema directly from the Propel schema file, ensuring consistency between your PHP models and the actual database structure.

---

### propel sql:insert

- **Command**: `propel sql:insert`
- **Description**: Executes the SQL statements generated by `propel sql:build` to create the database schema in your actual database.
- **Output**: Messages indicating the execution of SQL statements against the database.
- **Purpose**: Effectively creates your database schema as defined in Propel, setting up tables, relationships, and other database structures.

## Additional Notes

- **Project Specifics**: Ensure that you run these commands in the root directory of your Propel project where the configuration files are located.
- **Version Compatibility**: Check for Propel and PHP version compatibility.
- **Database Credentials**: Ensure your database credentials and settings are correctly set in the Propel configuration file before running these commands.
